    "Insight Maker is a power simulation tool. In this report, we demonstrated a simple rabbit population model using Insight Maker. One stock was used for rabbit population and one incoming flow for birth rate, the other for death rate.  The model was verified by the equal birth rate and death rate case. The verification case has the results as expected. The total rabbit population remains the same as the initial 100. The output shows the rabbit population would increase exponentially when the birth rate is larger than death rate. The most important lesson learned from this exercise is that we need to understand the concepts of stock and flow first before we create the insight and run the model."
