    "Agent-based model is used to simulate actions and interactions of autonomous agens. In this report, an agent-based model of moose-cow-grass competitive condition was implemented and evaluated using NetLogo. The model from NetLogo was verified by two simple cases. Finally, the values in the sliders was experimented to find a populations of either species or the grass from crashing. Intuitively, the system will be at equilibrium when the reproduce rate of two species are similar or the same. Therefore, the reproduce rates of two species were varied while other parameters remained the same. When the reproduce rates of two species equal 1, the system was most stable and almost at equilibrium after 500 or 1000 epochs. The number of cows and mooses were equalibrated at 1200 and 900 respectively. The number of mooses was increased exponentially at the beginning perhaps due to the larger initial numbers and less energy spent every move. Other reproduce rates were tested but they didn't yield a stable results at the end.\n",

    "Agent-based model (ABM), also known as multi-agent system (MAS), if the agent is heterogeneous, it is called heterogeneous agent model (HAM) ) Is a computational model used to simulate the actions and interactions of autonomous agents (independent individuals or common groups, such as organizations, teams), and evaluate the role of agents in the overall system through image display. It combines some other ideas, such as game theory, complex systems, emergence, computational sociology, multi-agent systems, and evolutionary computing. The Monte Carlo method is used to generate randomness[1].\n",

    "* You might also consider increasing their sizes (the screenshots in this document were done with a size of 1.5)\n",
    "* The initial energy for both breeds should be 50 units\n",
    "* The number of initial moose and cows should be set through sliders (see the figure)\n",
    "* When a moose moves, it should use 2 units of energy\n",
    "* When a cow moves, it should use 3 units of energy\n",
    "* Both species, when they eat a patch of grass, should gain 10 units of energy\n",
    "* Cows and moose should reproduce when they have over 50 units of energy, but the number that they hatch should be set with sliders (see figure 1)\n",
